## Welcome
Welcome to OWASP Tulsa. We began in 2019, and then re-booted in 2022 when we were able to resume in-person meetups. We are part of a strong Tulsa tech & security community that overlaps with a number of organizations and events. OWASP Tulsa especially focuses on the OWASP mission to improve the security of software by hosting bi-weekly meetups (at [36°N](https://www.36n.co/)) to train software developers in tools and techniques to secure their applications:

* 2nd Tuesday of every month: Training meetup with an application security presentation
* 4th Tuesday of every month: "Hack Night" to learn application pen-testing tools and/or a CTF competition

Some other groups and events to check out:
* [Techlahoma](https://www.techlahoma.org/) - State-wide tech community
* [BSidesOK](https://bsidesok.com/) - InfoSec Conference
* [TU Cyber Summit](https://engineering.utulsa.edu/cyber-security-leadership-technology-summit/) - CyberSecurity conference
